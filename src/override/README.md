# Override

This code allows a micro:bit to send all of the radio messages which are used in the escape room.  It is not part of the challenge itself, but allows someone running the game to resend messages in the case that a message is not received correctly.  This lets you get the challenge back on track and avoid teams getting stuck.

Press the A button to cycle through the messages, then B to send.


## Equipment List

* A micro:bit (v1 or v2)
