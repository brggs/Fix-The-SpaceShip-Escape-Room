# Step 1a - Robots

This is the first step of the escape room.  In this step, there are four robots.  Each one has a secret letter, which the players must find to put the robots in order, and find the code to unlock the fuel for step 2. 

Each robot requires a different input to get it to reveal it's letter.  When the code first runs, the person setting up the game can choose which robot that micro:bit should act as.  My robots (in the photos below) have small dots at the bottom to remind me which one is which!  See the instructions in the code for how this works.

## Equipment List

* 4x micro:bit (v1 or v2)
* 4x battery packs
* Card to make the robots


## Build

1. Make robots, leaving a space in the design for the microbits to be attached.  Copy the robots above, or customise them.  You may also wish to change the code, and/or the letters the robots display.
2. Use the [micro:bit editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3/) to download the [code](battery.py) onto the micro:bits
3. Attach the micro:bits to the robots, with the battery packs.


## Setup/Reset

1. Turn the micro:bits on, and the robots are ready to go.

No reset is required for the robots in between play throughs, however you might want to rearrange them if a team has left them in the correct order.
