* Maybe swap out all the MBs in step one for RFID tags?  Might have to replace the MB with an arduino to make that work easily?
* Would have been cool to have a big wheel to enter the direction 
* Would be nice to have LEDs lighting up to show progress
* A 7-segment display might be better for displaying the time
* Instead of shouting the message - Convert a short message into morse code, then enter it using the A and B buttons
* Rechargable battery
* Have a page missing from the manual with instructions
* There's a piano attachment for the MBs, could use that to input a musical code
