Fix the Space Ship is a short escape room activity, designed to get kids interested in technology and coding. 

This repo contains all the code and designs used to create the activity.  I hope it is useful either as inspiration for creating similar escape rooms, or for even having a go at recreating this one for your own groups.

## Components

The Escape Room is made up of a series of different steps.  Each one is described in full in it's own Read Me file, which includes photos and a guide on how to build it.

### Manual

The Space Ship manual is given to teams at the start of the challenge, and tells them what they need to do at each step.

[Space Ship Manual](Spaceship%20Challenge%20Manual.pdf)

For an editable version, the original Google document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZmQcw_lCy3J1W7tHfdochccHPePtWkxOZ1arFSAfAo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Step 1 - Robots and Refeulling
Robots: [Read Me](src/step-1a/README.md) | [Code](src/step-1a/robots.py)<br />
Refuelling: [Read Me](src/step-1b/README.md) | [Code](src/step-1b/refuel.py)

Step 1 has teams putting robots in the correct order to find a code, which they use to unlock the fuel store.  They then have to fill up the fuel tank to the correct level.

### Step 2 - Charge the Battery
Battery: [Read Me](src/step-2/README.md) | [Code](src/step-2/battery.py)

In step 2 teams must charge a battery, by running around while holding it.


### Step 3 & 4 - Set the Course & Send a Message
Science Unit: [Read Me](src/science/README.md) | [Code](src/science/science.py)

Steps 3 and 4 are handled by the Science Unit console.  Teams must use the sensor readings to work out where they are, then set a course for space HQ.  They then shout a message into the microphone to say they're on their way home.


### Step 5 - Launch Sequence
Control Unit: [Read Me](src/control/README.md) | [Code](src/control/control.py)

In step 5, teams follow a frantic series of instructions shown on the control and science consoles.

## Parts List

This page lists all the [components](parts.md) used in the build of the escape room.  Each individual Read me also lists the parts used for that step.
