## Overview
* what it is - built as a reusable activity for STEM engagement.
* Goal - inspire kids to try their own.  So, you might  not have all the equipment used, but hopefully this will still be useful 
* Can recreate, see the equipment list.
* Shout if you need any help!

Made up of micro bits which communicate via radio.

Show the kids this sort of thing is easy to do - they could create their own escape room, or many other inventions with MBs or similar.  We need to communicate how cheap it was for us to put together.

Credit to Adrian for the boxes!

(Need to credit anyone for the art?)


## Components

Each of the parts are described in their own readmes alongside the code, inlcuding instructions for how to build.  A short summary of each:

### Manual

If you would like to get a feel for what has to be done at each step, read hte manual.  This is hte intsturctinos the team follow throughout hte challenge.

The original google doc is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UZmQcw_lCy3J1W7tHfdochccHPePtWkxOZ1arFSAfAo/edit?usp=sharing).

### Step 1 - Robots and Refeulling
